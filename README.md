# Very simple nvim configuration

Mostly using builtins (+ruff and ty).

## File management

- `:e <path>` to open a file (supports tab completion)
- `:b <buffer>` switch to an already opened file/buffer (supports tab completion)

## Completion

- `Ctrl+x+n` complete a keyword mentioned in the current file
- `Ctrl+x+f` complete a path
- `Ctrl+x+s` spell checking suggestions
